# autoMate
## AutoMate is a driver-less car app that allows users to request and schedule rides. 

In the near future, driver-less cars will dominate the highways. Much like the popularity of cloud services where customers no longer own software, people will no longer own cars. They will simply order a ride whenever needed. The expense would be offset by the lack of car payment, auto insurance, vehicle maintenance and fuel costs. Car dealerships and rental car companies will be converted to driver-less car parking and service lots. Private companies will also appear offering their own spin on the driver-less car experience.

A user will sign up, log in, enter a location, destination and time. Vehicle options will include economy, mid-size, luxury and carpool. They can order immediate one-way or round-trip rides and schedule future pick-ups or recurring rides for daily commute. Google Maps will be used to calculate distance and commute times for pricing. Users will be shown a cost before clicking the SUBMIT button at which time, their order will be entered in a database and a vehicle engaged. Once the vehicle arrives, a txt message is sent to the customer’s phone prompting them that the vehicle has arrived and to confirm by responding to the txt with the confirmation number once they are safely in the vehicle and seatbelt is fastened. The ride is complete once the vehicle has reached its destination address.
